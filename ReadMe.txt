ReadMe for Reg-a-Lot Registration System

--Overview--

The Reg-a-Lot Registration System (from here on known as the "System")is the registration system developed by the Made-up College Information Systems department for use by Made-Up College's (from here on known as "College" or "School") students, professors, and registrar officers and employees (from here on known as "User").

The system is designed to be to used in conjunction with the School's database located on its Microsoft SQL Server.

The System is accessed through an initial login box asking for the User's credentials, a user ID and a password. The user ID is randomly generated and is unique to that User's personal information. Permissions levels are based on that User's role within the system (i.e. Students are not able to assign Professors to courses and Professors are not able to edit other User data or course data.)

--User Roles--

The Registrar and it's employees are considered the administrators of the System and have sole control over editing User data, Course information, and Section information. They are able to delete and add in Users, Courses, and Sections as well.

Professors are able to select which sections they are wishing to teach as well as set grades for each Student in those specific sections.

Students are able to Add and Drop courses as well as check their grades within the System for the specific course.

Students and Professors can not edit their own User information except for changing their account password.

--Known Bugs and Technical Issues--

Registrar cannot edit Section information.

Students cannot Add/Drop courses.
